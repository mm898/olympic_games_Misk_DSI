1. hypothesis is not clear. 
2. focused on comparison between female and male.
3. In the "Number of males and females who won the medals" and other figure,
    the number of the medals will be proportional to the participent, 
    so a better graph might involve the proportions of each medal. 
4.some of the axes have overlapping text, specially for categorical variables.
