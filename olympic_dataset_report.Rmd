# Step1 (Data exploring and EDA):
## We will start by importing the dataset
```{r}
olympic <- read.csv("data/athlete_events.csv")
region<-read.csv("data/noc_regions.csv")
```

# We started by exploring our dataset
```{r}
#take a look of our data
glimpse(olympic)
skim(olympic)
summary(olympic)
str(olympic)
```

# Then generated an EDA report using DataExplorer
```{r eval = FALSE}
create_report(olympic, 
              output_file = "olympics_EDA_report.html", 
              output_dir = "EDA_reports/")
```


# Step2 (Data cleaning):

### We figured out that we need to do column name cleaning using janitor package
```{r}
olympic_df <- clean_names(olympic)
region_df<- clean_names(region)
```


### We will merge the two dataset
```{r}
olympic_game <- merge(olympic_df,region_df,by="noc")

summary(olympic_game)

```


## Then, modified the data type to be factor
```{r}
olympic_game$sex <- as.factor(olympic_game$sex)
olympic_game$season <- as.factor(olympic_game$season)
olympic_game$city <- as.factor(olympic_game$city)
olympic_game$sport <- as.factor(olympic_game$sport)
olympic_game$event <- as.factor(olympic_game$event)
olympic_game$country <- as.factor(olympic_game$team)
olympic_game$noc <- as.factor(olympic_game$noc)
```


## Our dataset has missing values in the medal column. Thus, we decided to deal with them

```{r}
sum(is.na(olympic_game)) 

# remove NULL value in medal 
# the NULL mean not winning any medals
olympic_game %>% 
  group_by(olympic_game$medal) %>% 
  count(olympic_game$medal)

olympic_game$medal[is.na(olympic_game$medal)] = "Not win"
table(olympic_game$medal)

#modify type of data
olympic_game$medal <- as.factor(olympic_game$medal)
```

# Step 3 (find answers to our questions):

### Q1: What is the total number of sporting events (for winter and summer)?
```{r}
#Total number of sporting events (for winter and summer)

#Unique Olympic sports
unique(olympic_game$sport)

#Number of Unique Sports
length(unique(olympic_game$sport))
```


### Q2: What is the total number of sporting events (for winter and summer)?

```{r}

count_year_season <- olympic_game %>%
  group_by(year, season) %>%

    Athletes = length(unique(id)),

### Q3: What is the top countries who won meadls?

```{r}

# Step 4 (Hypothesis testing questions):
### Women growth since they joined the olympics
```{r}
#women growth

  summarise(contestants = length(unique(id))) -> Fgrouth

  ggtitle("Womens contestants through years") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
  facet_grid(Fgrouth$season)
```

### Men and women constantly growth
```{r}
#MEN GROUTH VS WOMENS
olympic_game %>%
 # filter(season == 'Summer') %>% 
  group_by(year , sex, season ) %>%
  summarise(contestants = length(unique(id))) -> FVSMinyears


ggplot(FVSMinyears ,aes(x = year, y = contestants ,color = sex ))+

  geom_line()+
  ggtitle("Mens and Womens contestants through years in both seasons") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
  facet_grid(FVSMinyears$season)
```


# Step 5 (Summary):
- While observing the data, a few major drops in the number of athletes and number of countries participating in the Olympic games was overseen which posed as a mystery where such decrease in the number of participants was due to a boycott that took place.
- For the 1980s, the number of female participants during the Olympic Summer Games has gradually increased and the total number of female participation during such multi-sport event is in fact expected to keep increasing for the upcoming years.
- Irregularities in the number of male participants was overseen in our analysis where is come years the participation of males increased and other years where it decreases (correlated to the Olympic Boycotts)
- An external dataset that contains data about the 2021 Olympics that were taken place in Tokyo was retrieved ,where the 45 sporting events contained within the dataset was compared in regard to the male and female distribution. Hence, for mostly all the sporting events there was in fact a 50-50%precent distribution for male and female athletes.
- After observing the data , the frequency distribution of male and female athletes throughout the years of Olympic history is in fact leaning towards gender equality where the number of females participating in the Olympic games has increased during both the summer and winter games
